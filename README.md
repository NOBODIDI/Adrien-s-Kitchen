# restaurant-website

In this project, I create a fully functional and responsive restaurant website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, from scratch. I deployed this website using netlify, and you can visit it at this address: [https://adrien-s-kitchen.netlify.app](https://adrien-s-kitchen.netlify.app)

The website is composed of 5 pages: home, menu, about, contact and booking pages. It is fully responsive as the layout adapts to all widths of screen, using the CSS media queries. It is also functional because the forms included on the website collects data, which is displayed on the Netlify dashboard.
